# Sample application to go with slides for Pascal Cafe 2024 Conference (IJsselstein ,Netherlands)

This is the sample application developed to show during _Pascal Cafe 2024_ conference.

See the conference slides on https://castle-engine.io/pascalcafe2024 .

I did not actually use this application during the presentation -- because we managed to make "live" a similar but not exactly the same application during presentation. So it was even better :) Still the application in this repo is nice to read along with slides.
